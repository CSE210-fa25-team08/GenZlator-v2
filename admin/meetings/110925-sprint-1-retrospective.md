Takeaways:

- Some great progress has been made, and team/work organization has been smooth  
- There are still a few design decisions to be made (e.g. necessity of a login page)  
- Will try to finish up most of ADRs by Tuesday meeting with TA  
- Communication should be more robust  
  - Try to have clearer indication of ADR progression
